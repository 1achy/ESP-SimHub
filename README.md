# SimHub firmware for ESP8266

## What is this?
Firmware source code for ESP8266 that is compatible with SimHub. It's derived from what SimHub lets you setup, but tweaked with a thin compatibility layer for the ESP8266.

## Why would you want to do this?
ESP8266 is cheaper and more powerful that most arduinos boards and fairly popular in the IoT Community.

## How To
- Download this code
- Install VSCode and Platformio
- Open with VSCode
- Adjust it however you need
- Upload it to your device

## Why Platformio?
It's better in almost every way than Arduino IDE, but more generic and more strict. It's worth learning it, trust me.
